- Determine font to use: https://fonts.google.com
- Make it clear to the user that gallery items can be clicked - e.g. show some info on mouse hover
- Use CloudFlare as CDN for performance: https://gist.github.com/cvan/8630f847f579f90e0c014dc5199c337b
    - configuration for domaindiscount24: https://www.domaindiscount24.com/faq/cname-eintrag
- enable left/right arrow key press to view next/previous gallery item in fullscreen view
- pre-load large images once website was fully loaded to make fullscreen view more enjoyable to use on slow connections
- re-prioritize image loading if image is view in fullscreen mode and has not been loaded yet
- show spinner in fullscreen view while image is being loaded
- think of using flexbox instead of grid layout to support wider range of browsers
